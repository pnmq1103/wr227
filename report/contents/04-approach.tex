\section{Approach}
This section presents the proposed method (or the method under consideration), and it should be substantially longer than the Introduction and Related Works sections. The architectural details must be described carefully and systematically. An illustrative figure is required, typically the key figure of the paper, clearly conveying the overall idea and showing all important components of the method.
