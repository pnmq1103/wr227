\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Datasets}

\subsection{Evaluation Protocol}
This subsection defines how model performance is assessed. It should include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUROC, F1-score, mAP).
  \item Data splitting strategy and any cross-validation or repeated-trial setup.
  \item Baselines used for comparison and criteria for fair evaluation.
  \item Any task-specific rules or conventions followed during evaluation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experimental Settings}
This subsection outlines the full implementation and training configuration for reproducibility:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Model architecture settings and important hyperparameters
        (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of epochs).
  \item Optimization algorithms and loss functions.
  \item Hardware and software environment (e.g., GPU type, deep learning framework).
  \item Data preprocessing and augmentation pipeline.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results and Discussion}
This subsection presents and analyzes the experimental results:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Quantitative results summarized in tables and figures.
  \item Qualitative results when appropriate.
  \item Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.
  \item Insights on why the proposed method performs well and any limitations or failure cases.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Comparison Experiments}
This subsection reports direct comparisons with existing approaches:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Performance comparison with classical baselines and recent state-of-the-art methods.
  \item Analysis of cases where the proposed method excels.
  \item Discussion of scenarios where performance is comparable or lower.
  \item Positioning of the proposed method within the broader research landscape.
        There should be multiple tables \ref{tab1} and figures \ref{fig2} for demonstration and clarity.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Ablation Study}
This subsection evaluates the contribution of each component of the proposed method:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Removal or modification of individual modules or strategies.
  \item Measurement of performance change to quantify each component’s importance.
  \item Justification of design decisions based on empirical evidence.
\end{itemize}
